Installation

To get started with the installation of the JSON server, all we need to do is to open the Terminal of our system and type the following command.

    npm install -g json-server  

The next step involves the creation of a database with JSON. For the sake of learning, we have created an example database as shown below.
We are almost done. The next step is to start the JSON Server and to do that use the below command.

    json server --watch db.json  
    
    then install 
    npm install 
    start  npm
    
    enjoy
